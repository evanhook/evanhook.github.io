    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
    <p>I am just beginning my journey into the world of programming. I have a BA in art history from Willamette University, a small liberal arts college in Salem, Oreogn.</p>
    <p>I currently work on the Marketing team at Vacasa, a vacation rental management, as a project coordinator. Working in marketing means that I get to collaborate with a ton of different teams throughout the company. I grew more and more interested with the tech side of things and started networking to learn more about different opportunities and paths that people took to build their skills. A friend told me about Epicodus and I attended a workshop to learn more. I was immediately excited by the things that we were learning and decided to enroll in the evening program to continue learning and (hopefully) make a career change!</p>
